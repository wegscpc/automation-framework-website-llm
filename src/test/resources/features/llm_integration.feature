Feature: LLM Integration Test
  As a tester
  I want to ensure the application works as expected
  So that I can verify the functionality using AI/LLM

  Scenario: Verify page elements using LLM
    Given I open the browser and navigate to "https://www.google.com"
    When I analyze the page elements using LLM
    Then I should see the expected welcome message
    And I should validate the page content using LLM
